    <string name="startPoint">1944. You are a private soldier in USA army. You will get your mission objectives from Captain Miller. He is waiting for you near the aircraft.</string>
    <string name="commander"> Your mission, code-named Black Valkyrie, is to gather vital intelligence on enemy operations and disrupt their plans.</string>
    <string name="stealth">You move stealthily through the forest, hoping to avoid detection by enemy patrols. After a while, you stumble upon an enemy encampment, which may contain valuable information. Choose your next move:</string>
    <string name="theMissionStartsText">You and your group, called "Revenge 24" have been dropped behind enemy lines with minimal equipment and must rely on your skills and instincts to survive. The success of this mission could turn the tide of the war. Choose your next move wisely:</string>
    <string name="vantagePoint">From your vantage point, you spot enemy soldiers approaching your previous location. Choose your next move:</string>
    <string name="locals">You move to a nearby village to talk with locals about the area. You can see a few houses and a small market with activity in the middle as you get closer. Which method would you prefer?</string>
    <string name="camp">You set up a makeshift camp to rest and plan your next move. Find a secluded spot in the forest away from prying eyes and contemplate your options for the next phase of the mission. Choose your next move.</string>
    <string name="during_the_observation_you_found_out_that_the_enemy_keeps_some_british_soldiers_as_captives_what_do_you_do">During the observation, you found out that the enemy keeps some British soldiers as captives. What do you do:</string>
    <string name="infiltration_text">You started the infiltration, but the enemy was more powerful. You were injured badly and died in pain. But there was a bright point: the British soldiers could escape. They delivered the information they gained to their base. It helped to plan the Omaha Beach fight. Also, they told about you, and you got the USA Medal of Honor posthumously.</string>
    <string name="circling_around_text">Due to your sudden attack, the German soldiers surrendered. Now you have the information you needed, but the British guy tells you that their base is in trouble and wants you to help them.</string>
    <string name="mine_text">"There were no signs of trouble, but suddenly, boom! A mine appeared under your foot. You died, and no one knows what happened later. "</string>
    <string name="hero">You came home. And because you served with honor, you and your group were given a medal as WW2 heroes. The information you gained helped in planning the invasion of France.</string>
    <string name="treasure">While you were digging a trench, you found a chest full of gold. Maybe it was left by Jews, or maybe it belonged to Nazi soldiersâ€”no one knows. You and your team decided to divide the treasure. And start a new life. You moved to Italy and lived in richness. Meanwhile, the war ended, but because you didn\'t finish your mission, it ended in 1967 with the victory of the USSR. Adolf Hitler was judged and condemned to death. But he died in prison in 1970.</string>
    <string name="interception">You tried to intercept the group of enemies, but you didn\'t know that this was only the first division of a huge legion. You and your group died during fights. You fought heroically, but sadly, no one will remember your heroism.</string>
